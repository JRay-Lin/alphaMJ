# Mahjong Game Logic Tests

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the Mahjong game logic implementation.

## Test Files

- **`test/test_game_logic.py`** - Main test suite with all test cases
- **`run_tests.py`** - Test runner with category support (in project root)
- **`TEST_README.md`** - This documentation file

## Test Categories

### 1. Game Logic Tests (`game`)
Tests core game initialization and basic mechanics:
- Game setup and initialization
- Initial hand dealing (13 tiles per player)
- Drawing tiles from wall
- Discarding tiles
- Empty wall handling

### 2. Player Actions Tests (`actions`) 
Tests chi/pong/kong action mechanics:
- Action detection (can player perform action?)
- Action execution (properly modify hand and sets)
- Tile count validation after actions
- Priority handling

### 3. Win Conditions Tests (`win`)
Tests winning logic and priority:
- Win detection with specific tiles
- Win priority over other actions
- Proper game ending on win declaration

### 4. Turn Logic Tests (`turns`)
Tests turn progression and tile counts:
- Normal turn progression
- Correct tile counts after actions
- Turn skipping logic after chi/pong
- Kong replacement tile handling

### 5. Game State Management Tests (`state`)
Tests AI integration and game state:
- AI player setup
- Game state generation for AI
- AI decision making interfaces

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
python run_tests.py
# or
python run_tests.py --category all
```

### Run Specific Category
```bash
python run_tests.py --category game      # Basic game logic
python run_tests.py --category actions   # Player actions
python run_tests.py --category win       # Win conditions
python run_tests.py --category turns     # Turn logic
python run_tests.py --category state     # Game state management
```

### Run Tests Directly
```bash
python test/test_game_logic.py         # Run all tests
python -m unittest test.test_game_logic # Alternative method
```

## Adding New Tests

To add new tests:

1. **Add test methods** to existing test classes in `test_game_logic.py`
2. **Follow naming convention**: `test_<functionality_being_tested>`
3. **Use descriptive docstrings** explaining what the test validates
4. **Include setup/teardown** if needed in `setUp()` method
5. **Test both success and failure cases** where applicable

### Example Test Structure

```python
def test_new_functionality(self):
    """Test description of what this validates."""
    # Arrange
    setup_data = self.create_test_scenario()
    
    # Act  
    result = self.game.some_method(setup_data)
    
    # Assert
    self.assertEqual(result, expected_value)
    self.assertTrue(some_condition)
```

## Debugging Failed Tests

When tests fail:

1. **Check the error message** - shows which assertion failed
2. **Review test setup** - ensure test data is correct
3. **Add debug prints** if needed to understand state
4. **Run single test** to isolate the issue:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest test_game_logic.TestClassName.test_method_name
   ```

## Integration with Development

- **Run tests before commits** to ensure no regressions
- **Add tests for new features** as they're developed
- **Update tests** when game rules change
- **Use tests to validate bug fixes**

The test suite ensures the Mahjong game logic remains correct and reliable as the codebase evolves.
